Subject: use case on natural language processing using nltk and spacy libraries on war and peace
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
We study natural language processing in this module using nltk and spacy libraries. We first load and read the file "War and peace.txt", 
a book by Leo Tolstoy. We break the file into words and punctuations (tokenize) and then extract a small range of data from the file as 
a list, after removing punctuations. We carry out stemming using lancaster and porter stemmers, and POS tagging. As a final step, detailed
POS tagging is carried out using the spacy library.

Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
